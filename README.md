yarn install
npm run test

Results in vitest failing:
![vitest failure](<Screenshot 2024-04-15 at 10.23.25â€¯PM.png>)

Commenting out the `build()` plugin in vite.config.ts results in tests passing. Something in the plugin is causing an issue.

Oddly, if you log the test method it seems it is actually defined

```tsx
import {test, expect} from "vitest";
console.log({test})
test("should pass", () => {
  expect(1 + 1).toBe(2);
})
```
